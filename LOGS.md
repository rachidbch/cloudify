# Cloudify session log

## 2026-08-31

- Recorded the successful XFCE and Guacamole oracle and the next Omarchy VM automation path.
- Aborted and trashed the mistaken local Omarchy ISO download before any VM creation.

## 2026-08-31 (session 2) — Omarchy parked

- Root-caused the cloudstation SSH blocker: `/etc/hosts` pinned cloudstation to its public IP, bypassing MagicDNS. Pin removed by user; `ssh cloudstation` now goes over tailnet (MagicSSH), no passphrase needed.
- Exa-grounded every plan assumption: Arch + Hyprland base, v4.0.1 ISO + checksum, Incus ISO/cidata mechanics, xrdp/Wayland incompatibility, wayvnc as the community remote-desktop path, no container precedent (domarchy/devmarchy findings).
- User decisions: no Incus VM on the 8 GiB host; Omarchy deferred until community container support exists. ADR-016 supersedes ADR-015.
- Minted the tag:incus authkey via `ivps tag create incus` (reported; reusable; expires 2026-09-01 02:05).
